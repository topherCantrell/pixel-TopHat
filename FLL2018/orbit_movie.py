Each row has one orbiter 8 to 24 long. Each created orbiter has a random wait to appear (as below)
All orbiters travel right at speeds: 3,4, or 5.
Orbiters scroll on and off.
When orbiter dies, wait random 8 frames and create a new one, but only create 100 total orbiters.
Continue moving until all orbiters are done
