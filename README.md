# Construction

The dimensions are tricky. I want the LEDs to fit perfectly in a grid around the hat. The circumference has to be fixed to a whole unit of pixel spacing. Same with the height and brim width.

Gary Dion found much cheaper neo solutions on ebay.

I bought five of these for $184.25:

I bought 4 meters of 144/m of these for $67.20:

The plan is for the band to be 68x16 pixels. 16 high gets me most of the arcade sprites (pacman, etc). I thought the circle plate would be nice on top, but I may want the top oval. The strips are to fill in the brim (and probably top).
