# PixelHat

A top hat covered in NEO pixels for the 2017/2018 FIRST Robotics season.

Central cylinder is roughly 635mm by 204mm.

Adafruit strips: 60 LEDs per meter. I want to maintain X/Y dimensions on the hat (a grid).

10 pixels high would be 10/60 = 166mm
38 pixels wide would be 38/60 = 633mm

633 * 10 = 6.33 meters of strip -- 7 meters @ 22 = $154
