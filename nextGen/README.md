# 2nd Generation

I am making a new hat! Hopefully the soldering will be sturdier this time around.

One 32x8 grid is 32cm by 8cm. Total body is 64x16cm

The pixel ring on the top is radius 172mm

I glued the grid strips onto foam to make a cylinder. Carefully measuring the inner
circumference with a strip of paper: 635mm

```
circumference = 635mm
minor axis = 172mm / 2 = 86

calculating major: 115.073mm * 2 = 230.15mm
```

3D print a top 10mm high with indention for ring and slots for wires.
