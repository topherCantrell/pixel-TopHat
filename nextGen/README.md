# 2nd Generation

I am making a new hat! Hopefully the soldering will be sturdier this time around.

One 32x8 grid is 32cm by 8cm

The pixel ring on the top is radius 85.5mm (diameter 171mm)

The body/top will be an ellipse 

a = long axis (calculate this)
b = short axis (85.5mm)
circumference = 640mm

trying the calculator for various values -- a = 117mm
